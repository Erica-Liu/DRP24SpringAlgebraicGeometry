## Project Summary

possible other blues/colours we could use that might look less startling?
<span style="color:blue">original blue</span>
<span style="color:dodgerblue">dodgerblue</span>
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">cornflowerblue</span>
<span style="color:deepskyblue">deepskyblue</span>
<span style="color:slateblue">slateblue</span>
<span style="color:darkturquoise">turquoise</span>
<span style="color:forestgreen">forestgreen</span>
<span style="color:blueviolet">blueviolate</span>

We wanted to investigate how we could relate Geometry and Algebra, and what that could look like computationally through the use of a Computer Algebra System. 

### The Theoretical Concepts
